== Defensio

* Complete doc of Defensio API: Defensio::Client
* Plugin doc: Defensio::ActsAs::ClassMethods

=== Installation

1. Install the plugin
  script/plugin install http://code.macournoyer.com/svn/plugins/defensio/
2. Get an API key at http://defensio.com and dump it in config/defensio.yml
3. Add new column to your spammable model
  script/generate defensio_migration comment

You're ready to go!

=== Usage

In your "article" class, add:

  acts_as_defensio_article

In your "comment" class, add:

  acts_as_defensio_comment :fields => { :content => :comment }

The :fields option allows you to configure fields that are sent
to Defensio to classify a comment.

Look at Defensio::Client for a list of all those fields.

In the controller, before creating a comment set the request environment variables:
  @comment.env = request.env

Then when the comment is created the +spam+, +spaminess+ and +signature+
columns will magically be set for your own pleasure.
